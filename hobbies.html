<p> I loved computer games since I was a litte kid. Any kind of sport did not come into my mind to try, even thought at school I was realy good at sports, no matter what it was:
gymnastic, running, footbal, basketball, i was good at them. But the sport that took my mind as a teenager was gym training and calisthenics. I started at the age of 17 and did not stop 
since then. It was a pleasure and also a benefit for me. I stopped playing games and started training, started eating and sleeping better at the same time. A year later, I was unrecognisable.
It changed my life in good, I am more productive and learned that if you want to do something good in life for you and for the others, you need to work hard for it.</p>

<p>But the most hours played are in Rocket League, currently having over 2700 hours in game.Yes you can say that I liked this game a lot, but right now 
I am not  as keen on playing anymore just because I am changed and like spending more time in the real world with real people. </p>

<H1>COMPUTER BUILDING:</H1>
<img class="calcul" src="pozecomp/computerbuild.jpg" alt="computer build">
<p>I like building computers just as much as I liked playing on them. I remember my first build. I was so eager to build my first computer.The dopamine
release on such activity for me was extremely high and the satisfaction at the end, seeing the pc start for the first time, it is something just as beautiful
as a fowering tree.</p>
<h1></h1>
<p> Since then I build more systems for friends and family. I started to know more about each component, what it does and how important it is, therefore i was able
to come with recommandations for people. They will tell me what they need the computer for and I was making them the best configuration I could find at their specific 
budget.</p>
<p> I also was able to make some money from this on the mining period when everyone was going after ethereum. I took advantage of this and started to snipe 
good prices on graphics cards to flip them. It was so much fun and somewhat educational because I learned how to talk more with people and how to negotiate better.
I was able to make a profit of 1000 euros, which for a teenager is really good, I was more than satisfied.
