<p>Here is where I studied at the school nr2. from Piatra Neamt. I spent 8 years in here and loved every second of it. I did good things and also a lot of
bad things. First 4 years I was extremely dutiful but after that not so much. The last 4 years in the mid school was when I can say I learned how to study.The 8 grade was the 
first year when i had to take an exam. it was stressful but and difficult for me at that time. </p>

<h1>HIGH SCHOOL</h1>

<p> Here is the highschool where I studied. It was not as fun as in mid school but I quickly adapt to it. Teachers were more serious than before, and more severe.
Can't say that it was not good beacuse i learned a lot in high school. </p>
<h1></h1>
<p>Every single teacher is eager to respond to any missunderstanding that students have, and really know how to communicate with each one of us.They adapt to each 
personaity and give the best answer possible so that anyone can understand and apply what they learned.</p>
<h1></h1>
<p>It is a big highschool that also has a canteen and a student dormitory. And was really useful because a lot of students outside Piatra Neamt come to this high school.
Another good thing about it was that this dormitory helped some of the Ucranian people have a temporary home. We also helped by donating: money, food, clothes that we do not need and many other things</p>
