The most important lab. I will write the hole task to better understand the code
Create a firmware that performs the stopwatch function, displaying a two-digit intermediate time: seconds and hundredths of milliseconds (the digit for seconds will display numbers with decimal point).The maximum measuring time is 9.9 seconds. The stopwatch will have three buttons: START (RA1), STOP/RESET (RA2) [two-function button: short press=STOP; long press=RESET] and INTERMEDIATE TIME (RA3). When pressing the START button, the time will start to run. When pressing the INTERMEDIATE TIME button, the intermediate time value registered at that point will be stored. By pressing briefly the STOP/RESET button, the stopwatch will stop and the value reached at that point will be displayed. If the chronometer is in STOP mode, by pressing the INTERMEDIATE TIME button, the intermediate time value will be displayed and a LED (connected to RA0) will light up, signaling that the digits show the intermediate time value. If the INTERMEDIATE TIME button is pressed again, the display will show the time value registered when the STOP button was pressed and the LED connected to the RA0 pin will go off.  If the stopwatch is in STOP mode, when the INTERMEDIATE TIME button is pressed again, the intermediate time value will be displayed and a LED (connected to RA0) will light up, signaling that the digits show the intermediate time value.
